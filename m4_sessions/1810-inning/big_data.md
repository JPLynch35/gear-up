Debate  

Context: When you’re on Facebook every click, mouse move, video you watch, and search you make is being tracked and influencing the advertising that is being directed towards you.  

Debate viewpoints  

I believe that big data increases the efficiency of companies, enhances the end user experience and will lead to better internet. Big data collection should remain legal and unregulated.  

I believe that big data is a violation of privacy, its creepy, companies shouldn’t be monitoring my every move. Big data collection should regulated by the government and tracking should be limited.
